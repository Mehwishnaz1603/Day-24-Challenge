             //ðŸš€ Day 24 Challenge: Start Coding! ðŸš€//
//Question 70: Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword
//to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.

function printNumbersWithLet() {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        // Uses `let` for loop variable `i`
        console.log(i); }
}
printNumbersWithLet();

//Question 71: Compare let and const: Create two examples where let allows reassignment but const does
//not. Try to reassign a const-declared variable and catch the error.
let number  = 25;
number  = 26; // Works fine because `let` allows reassignment
console.log(number); // Shows 26

// Trying to reassign a `const`-declared variable
const name = "MehwishNaz";
try {name = "Noor"; // This line will cause an error
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Error: Can't reassign a `const`-declared variable."); // This message is shown
}
//Question 72: Block Scope with let and const: Demonstrate block scope by creating a code block with {} that
//uses both let and const. Show how variables declared inside the block are not accessible outside of it.

{
    let blockLet = "visible inside the block";
    const blockConst = "also only inside the block";
    console.log(blockLet); // Works fine here
    console.log(blockConst); // Also works fine here
}
try {
    console.log(blockLet); // This will fail
} catch (error) {
    console.log("`blockLet` is not accessible outside the block.");
}
try {
    console.log(blockConst); // This will also fail
} catch (error) {
    console.log("`blockConst` is not accessible outside the block.");
}
